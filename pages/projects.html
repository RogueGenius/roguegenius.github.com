<h2>UN OCHA's LibyaCrisisMap.net</h2>
<p><strong>Providing realtime situational awareness for humanitarian groups</strong></p>
On March 1, 2011, UN OCHA made a formal request to the <a href="http://blog.standbytaskforce.com">Standby Task Force</a> to deploy a system to collect and present open source information coming out of Libya.  Within 24 hours, Rogue Genius team members working as part of the SBTF had installed, configured, and deployed the LibyaCrisisMap.net platform that was utilized by a wide array of humanitarian organizations to gain an understanding of what was taking place on the ground.  The deployment has received awards from the International Association for Emergency Management - more info <a href="http://roguegenius.com/libyacrisismap-net-wins-iaem-technology-awards">here</a>.<p style="padding-top:5px;padding-bottom:25px;"><strong>Team Members:</strong> George Chamales, John Etherton, Antonio Lettieri</p>

<h2>USAID Afghan Wells Water Tracker</h2>
<p><strong>Utilizing IVR to enable citizens to report water well problems</strong></p>
This project brings together a variety of different technologies to support the rapid identification and resolution of inoperable wells throughout Afghanistan.  The deployed capability collects messages from citizens on the ground using an Arabic interactive voice response (IVR) that is then forwarded to an online platform.  Received messages are mapped and an alert to water system mechanics is automatically dispatched.  The capability utilizes our data fusion system and is being extended to add more advanced data analysis and alerting methods.<p style="padding-top:5px;padding-bottom:25px;"><strong>Team Members:</strong> Rob Baker, John Etherton, George Chamales, Antonio Lettieri</p>

<h2>US Navy Exercise at RELIEF/Camp Roberts</h2>
<p><strong>Crowd-sourced microtasking for operational training</strong></p>
Large, established organizations such as the US Military are well positioned to make the most out of crisis mapping technology during large-scale disasters.  Our team has taken part in numerous RELIEF exercises sponsored by <a href="http://star-tides.net/">STAR-TIDES</a> and the <a href="http://www.hhi.harvard.edu/">Harvard Humanitarian Initiative</a>.  These exercises, which bring together members of the humanitarian, military, and government community provide an excellent opportunity to test out new technology and interaction approaches.  At the most recent exercise, members of our team utilized our microtasking platform to support the Navy's <a href="http://quick-nets.org">Quicknets team</a>.

<h2>ICRC Water Point Tracking in Africa</h2>
<p><strong style="padding-bottom:10px">Enabling rapid field assessments through mobile phones and data fusion</strong></p>
The ICRC has an established water tracking program in Africa, however the current collection process could be made more efficient and less error-prone.  Rogue Genius is supporting the ICRC in the creation and deployment of a system that enables them to take their existing data collection methods, automatically upload it to an online platform, track changes to that data over time, and download it in a variety of formats for use in the field.  Our next phase of the project will enable field workers to use offline-capable smartphones for data collection.

<h2>Sudan Referendum Vote Monitoring</h2>
<p><strong>Tracking issues at polling stations across the country</strong></p>
The <a href="http://www.sudaninstitute.org">Sudan Institute for Research and Policy</a> operated a successful vote monitoring deployment in 2009.  During the preparations for their second deployment to track events around the country's nation-wide referendum, they were abandoned by their technology partners.  Rogue Genius offered to support the deployment which was later further supported by the Standby Task Force.  The deployment faced numerous challenges including suspicious reports and having the site temporarily blocked from being viewed inside of Sudan.

<h2>Project (RED) World Aids Day Campaign</h2>
<p><strong>Platform to track social media trends around the world</strong></p>
In celebration of World Aids day on December 1, 2010, <a href="http://www.joinred.com/aboutred">Project (RED)</a>, launched the "Turn the World Red" campaign that collected social media messages from Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, FourSquare, & MeetUp.  Members of the Rogue Genius team were brought in by Ushahidi's Swift River team to support the development of the application.  The project combined very short deadlines, high visibility, an inflexible launch date, and numerous additional technological challenges.  Fortunately, the deployment was a success, and was cited during Project (RED)'s award at the 2011 Webby Award Ceremony.

<h2>UN OCHA Colombia Earthquake Simulation</h2>
<p><strong>International exercise & first deployment of the Standby Task Force</strong></p>
The Standby Task Force was invited to take part in a three day earthquake simulation being run by UN OCHA.  The exercise simulated a major earthquake striking the Colombian capitol city of Bogota.  Members of the UN OCHA simulation team created a set of over 500 simulated SMS messages that were submitted to the online platform being used by the SBTF.  Those messages were translated, categorized, geolocated, analyzed and presented back to the coordinators to provide situational awareness.  The exercise was an excellent opportunity for members of the newly formed SBTF to demonstrate their capabilities and interact with a major humanitarian organization.  The final report from the SBTF is <a href="http://blog.standbytaskforce.com/columbia-earthquake-simulation-%E2%80%93-testing-ground-for-volunteer-mapping-and-response-cooperation/">available here</a>.

<h2>Pakistan Nationwide Flood Tracking</h2>
<p><strong>International team of volunteers to collect & geolocate reports</strong></p>
As floodwaters began to rise throughout Pakistan, Faisal Chohan, Pakistani CEO of <a href="http://www.cogilent.com">Cogilent Solutions</a> procured an SMS shortcode and deployed a basic crowdmap to track informatio from the disaster affected areas. As the site gained more traction, Rogue Genius provided support to the deployment, eventually taking over as the technical coordinators for the platform.  The deployment attracted volunteers from around the world who utilized crowdsourcing to geolocate messages from remote locations.

<h2>Tracking Riots in Oakland, California</h2>
<p><strong>Night of civil unrest in downtown Oakland mapped through Twitter</strong></p>
On July 8, 2010, a verdict in a wrongful death suit against a local police officer sparked a night of isolated riots throughout downtown Oakland, California.  The night was thoroughly covered in the mainstream and social media - with news helicopters following masses of people and many citizens on the ground tweeting and sharing photos from the events taking place.  The event presented an excellent opportunity to collect these reports and utilize them to develop a real-time, on-the-ground perspective.  Local online news site the Bay Citizen has a <a href="http://www.baycitizen.org/mehserle-verdict/story/how-twittersphere-helped-keep-oakland/">short piece and video</a> with more information about the deployment.
