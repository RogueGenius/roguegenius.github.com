Ushahidi recently received a Webby Award for their contribution to social innovation on the Internet.  The announcement from Project (RED) highlighted some of the exceptional uses of the platform, including the World Aids Day project which included Rogue Genius team members Antonio Lettieri and George Chamales.

<blockquote>"Ushahidi", which means "testimony" in Swahili, is a website that was originally used in Kenya during the post-election fallout to map incidents of violence and peace efforts based on reports submitted via the web and mobile phones. The site was the catalyst for the development of a platform which could be used by others globally. Since then, the platform has empowered people around the world by democratizing information and increasing transparency. It was used to coordinate rescue and relief efforts in the aftermath of the Haiti earthquake, to create a map of the Gulf oil spill crisis and on World AIDS Day 2010 by (RED) to track more than 100,000 actions people took on the social networks to raise awareness of the fight against AIDS and the ability to deliver a virtually AIDS free generation in 2015.</blockquote>
