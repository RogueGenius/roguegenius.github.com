Members of the Rogue Genius team are entering a phase where we will be focusing on a set of longer-term projects.  Details on the projects will be made available once they're ready to see the light of day, but until then there will be very few updates made to the Rogue Genius blog.  If you'd like to contact any members of our team please see the <a href="pages/team.html">Team page</a>.
