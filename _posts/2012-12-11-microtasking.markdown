The [Rogue Genius Micro-Tasking System](http://roguegenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/RogueGenius-MicroTaskingSystem-1pager.pdf) enables organizations to create information processing assembly lines to manage large volumes of data. In the Micro-Tasking System, each member of a team performs a single task on a message as it moves from unstructured data towards final approval as a finished report. The system is built using a modular architecture which makes it possible to create custom assembly lines tailored to your specific needs.
  
The Micro-Tasking System is built on top of the [Ushahidi Platform](http://ushahidi.com) and contains a variety of built-in features including:

  * **Security**: Workers can only view tasks they are assigned, allowing sensitive tasks such as Anonymization to take place using a select group of trusted users.

  * **Dynamic Ordering**: Tasks can be enabled, reordered, run in parallel, or disabled

  * **Statistics**: Use the system's dashboard to view task queues and progress graphs

  * **Messaging**: Contact workers using in-screen messages or email each task team separately
