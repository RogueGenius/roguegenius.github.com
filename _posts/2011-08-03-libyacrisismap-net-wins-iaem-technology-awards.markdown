From the Standby Task Force Blog guest post by [Gisli Olafsson](http://twitter.com/#!/gislio) of [NetHope](http://nethope.org/):


<blockquote> The IAEM, which has more than 5,000 members in 58  countries, is a non-profit educational organization dedicated to promoting the goals of saving lives and protecting property during emergencies and disasters. It is a great testament to the cross-organizational collaboration and the fantastic volunteer effort involved in making the Libya Crisis Map a reality that both the European Awards Committee and the Global Awards Committee awarded it the first place award for technology and innovation.</blockquote>
