Team member George Chamales and the Wilson Center are happy to announce a new policy memo on the issues surrounding trust in social media and crowdsourcing.  The brief is being released at a time when the problems facing the use of these technologies have been highlighted by recent events ranging from inaccuracies in the hunt for suspects in the Boston bombings and false Twitter messages claiming terrorist attacks at the White House.

From the policy memo:

<blockquote>Individuals and organizations interested in using social media and crowdsourcing currently lack two key sets of information: a systematic assessment of the vulnerabilities in these technologies and a comprehensive set of best practices describing how to address those vulnerabilities. Identifying those vulnerabilities and developing those best practices are necessary to address a growing number of incidents ranging from innocent mistakes to targeted attacks that have claimed lives and cost millions of dollars.</blockquote>

Thanks again to the [Wilson Center's Commons Lab](http://wilsoncommonslab.org/) for the opportunity to continue working on this challenging topic.
