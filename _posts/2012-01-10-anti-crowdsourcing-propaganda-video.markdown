A video apparently demonstrating a number of attacks against crowdsourcing has been posted online.  The video uses an attractive Russian woman who:
  * Accuses the operators of the site of being in league with malicious foreign powers
  * Submits false messages to a crowdsourcing site via phone
  * Submits false messages to a crowdsourcing site via online form
  * Encourages others to submit false reports to the site

While it is unclear who the source and intended audience of the video is, the thoroughness and relatively high production value do indicate a professional organization very interested in the security of these types of deployments.

From the translation:

<blockquote>Well, exactly as we expected, 5 minutes later, our report appeared on the map, and was automatically listed as an election violation.  The election process, you can confirm how we did everything, how we wrote everything, our make-belief city's right here, and all our words.<br/><br/>

Want to know why the authors of this map are so trusting? Why do members of the organization Golos publicly celebrate every hundred and every thousand reports like their anniversaries?<br/><br/>
  
The goal here isn't just in their primary goal to delegitimize and present the Russian elections in the worst light but in deep-rooted, personal interests.  Simply, the number of total recorded cases directly influences the financing of Golos' local branches post-elections.  It's not hard to conclude that the lion's share of these tales they invent and send it in to themselves.<br/><br/>
  
What next? After the elections, they will proudly report to us and to the rest of the world the grand scale of falsification, in the winner's favor.  Financed by the same external entities that finance Golos, marginal politicians will take to the streets and the mythical violations from the map will become a reason to seriously demand the reevaluation of the election results, and along with the results, a reevaluation of the entire government structure of Russia.</blockquote>
