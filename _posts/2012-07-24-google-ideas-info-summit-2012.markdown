George's presentation was focused on the current trends in computer security facing activists.    
  
From George's Innovation Lab description:

<blockquote>Rogue Genius:  Attacks on Activists Through Insecure Technology<br/><br/>

Rogue Genius's George Chamales is an expert in how crowdsourcing, communications, and mapping technologies are attacked and infiltrated by hostile actors. Participants learn about recent attacks against these technologies and discuss the creation of a worldwide repository of defensive best practices. They leave with a set of defensive principles and an organizational proposal.</blockquote>

We would like to thank Google and the attendees for their time in making this an excellent conference.
