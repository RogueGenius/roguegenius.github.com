Team members Rob Baker and George Chamales are happy to release the above infographic which depicts a number of the security challenges that crisis mapping deployments have faced over the last two years.

The infographic was developed as part of our presentation at the first annual [IEEE Global Humanitarian Technology Conference](http://ieeeghtc.org) which was just concluded in Seattle.  The conference was well attended by a wide variety of representatives from the humanitarian, academic, and professional technology community including several familiar faces from the crisis mapping / response community.

You can download the high resolution pdf of the infographic [here](/files/Securing_Crisis_Maps_Infographic.pdf).
