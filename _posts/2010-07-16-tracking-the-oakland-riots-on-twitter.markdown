Rogue Genius team member George Chamales was interviewed by the Bay Citizen following his work on tracking a night of riots in Oakland.

From the Bay Citizen:
<blockquote>In the aftermath of the Johannes Mehserle verdict, a team of citizen vigilantes used Ushahidi, an open source disaster mapping platform developed in Africa, and Twitter to minimize harm and save lives during the unrest that followed by giving real-time updates to the community. Ordinary citizens also used social media to amplify the call for non-violence during the looting and vandalism. As mainstream media churned out photos of shattered windows and burning dumpsters, the twittersphere, with the actual voices of the people on the ground, told a different story.
