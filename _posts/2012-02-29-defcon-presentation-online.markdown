Team member George Chamales' presentation at the [2011 Defcon Security Conference](https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-19/dc-19-index.html) has been posted on YouTube.  The recording was made in August of last year before a number of crisis mapping security incidents had taken place.  With that in mind, it is fascinating to observe the potential attacks that George discusses.  

Among the security concerns George raised last August:

  * Identification of drug cartels as a potential threat to those using online technology [as has happened in Mexico.](http://articles.cnn.com/2011-09-14/world/mexico.violence_1_zetas-cartel-social-media-users-nuevo-laredo?_s=PM:WORLD)
  * Counter-messaging to crisis-mapping deployments [like the Russian Anti-Crowdsourcing Propaganda video.](http://roguegenius.com/anti-crowdsourcing-propaganda-video)
  * Attacks on administrators through technology or arrests and torture [as was recently detected in Syria](http://www.cnn.com/2012/02/17/tech/web/computer-virus-syria/index.html?hpt=hp_t2)
  * Software vulnerabilities that expose sensitive information like those found in Ushahidi's [Somalia deployment.](http://blog.ushahidi.com/index.php/2012/02/01/somalia-speaks-lessons-from-novel-journalism/)

The presentation included a number of points where audience members were asked what they would do if they were the bad guys.  The responses clearly demonstrate the ease with which security professionals are capable of identifying weaknesses in the current approach to crowdsourced crisis mapping.  Thanks again to the Defcon organizers for giving us the opportunity to discuss this information with our peers in the security industry.
