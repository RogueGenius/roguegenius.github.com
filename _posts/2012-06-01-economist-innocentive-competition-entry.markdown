Team member George Chamales recently submitted an entry to the Economist Magazine’s Innovation Competition. The paper describes the work done over the last several years on various projects including the Haiti Cholera Epidemic, Afghanistan Wells tracking, and American Red Cross Disaster services logistics.

From the Economist’s Challenge Description:

<blockquote>It is easier to gather data today than at any other time in history, yet data remain an under-utilized resource. Trends in data can be difficult to spot, especially when individual unique perspective or expertise may be required to relate observations to meaningful occurrences in the world. This Challenge gives Solvers the chance to dive into public datasets and identify opportunities to improve communities based on the evidence discovered there.<br/><br/>

The increasing availability of data is enabling “smart” systems in cities and communities around the world. These systems are safer, more responsive to human needs, more convenient, and more efficient in terms of resource consumption than previous generations of the same technology. For example, new “smart” medical technologies communicate with your social networks from sensors inside or nearby your body, enabling you and your physicians to better monitor your health. This and numerous other examples of smart systems, many of which utilize advanced or distributed sensor technologies, may be found all over the world, and they all take advantage of the fact that information can be used as input to the dynamic behavior of the technological system. The Economist published a special report on smart systems, which can be found <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/17388368">here</a>.</blockquote>
