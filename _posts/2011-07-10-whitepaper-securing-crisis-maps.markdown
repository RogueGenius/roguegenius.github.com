The following short whitepaper, “Lives on the Line:  Securing Crisis Maps in Libya, Sudan, and Pakistan” was submitted as part of Rogue Genius team member George Chamales’ presentation to the Blackhat security conference.  From the introduction to the paper:

<blockquote>This paper introduces crisis mapping and utilizes examples drawn from real-world deployments to identify vulnerabilities that can be used in the development of security standards and best practices. These concepts are intended to help lay the foundation for methods to secure crisis mapping deployments, and help protect the people they serve when used in hostile environments.</blockquote>
