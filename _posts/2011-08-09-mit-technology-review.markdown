Rogue Genius team member George Chamales recently presented at the Defcon and Blackhat security conferences. The MIT Technology Review has an article covering the presentation and its implications for the broader crisis mapping community.

<blockquote>Crisis mapping has had a major impact in the last 18 months, helping to collate information and coordinate activities during the <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/editors/24672/">Haitian earthquake</a> in early 2010 and the <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/communications/35097/">Japanese tsunami</a> that struck earlier this year.

But crisis mapping tools are increasingly springing up in politically fraught situations, too; most notably, they have been used to provide humanitarian relief during the protests that have <a href="http://libyacrisismap.net/">swept through the Middle East</a> in recent months. Since some authorities may want to undermine these efforts, or even attack those involved, it’s becoming vital to protect these systems from interference, says <a href="http://www.blackhat.com/html/bh-us-11/bh-us-11-speaker_bios.html%23Chamales">George Chamales</a>, a hacker and activist who has served as technical lead for crisis map deployments in Libya, Pakistan, and Sudan.</blockquote>
