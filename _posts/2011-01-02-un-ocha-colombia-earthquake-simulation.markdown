UN OCHA Situation Room in Bogota - Ushahidi deployment on the main screen.
</div>

Rogue Genius team member George Chamales served as the technical lead for the Crisis Mapper’s Standby Task Force’s first full-scale deployment: supporting members of UN OCHA during their simulation of a large-scale earthquake taking place in Bogota, Colombia. You can read a description of the deployment on the SBTF’s website courtesy of Jaro Valuch:

UNOCHA (United Nation’s Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs) Colombia requested the participation of the Standby Task Force in the earthquake simulation exercise in order to test the ability of the crisis mapping volunteer network to participate and contribute to the emergency operations. The request specifically mentioned deployment of an Ushahidi platform since this tool was initially tested by UNOCHA Colombia during the earthquake simulation in 2009. What else could be a better opportunity to test some of the ideas and suggested protocols that are a result of lessons learned process?
