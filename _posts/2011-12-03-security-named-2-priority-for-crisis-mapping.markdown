At the recent [International Conference on Crisis Mapping](http://crisismappers.net/page/iccm-geneva-2011), Dr. Patrick Meier, provided a list of five priorities for the coming year in Crisis Mapping.  Security, specifically the need for standards and best practices, was listed as the number two priority for 2012.  From Dr. Meier's keynote.

<blockquote>A second theme is security. We all know that the majority of crisis mapping platforms and the technologies they integrate were not designed for highly hostile environments. At the same time, computer security is a highly specialized field and we are in serious need for security experts to lend their direct support at the coding level to resolve existing security risks. Talking is important, but coding is more important. Security experts who are members of the Crisis Mappers community already know what needs to be done. So lets get this done. What we do need to talk about is developing a clear and well defined set guidelines on how to handle Open (Social) Data that is crowdsourced from conflict zones. To be sure, we urgently need a code of conduct and one endorsed by an established and credible organization to hold ourselves accountable.</blockquote>

This timely announcement is a significant step forward in the movement to provide those using crisis mapping tools with the protection they need to utilize them safely.   You can read the full keynote by Dr. Meier [here](http://irevolution.net/2011/11/14/opening-speech-at-iccm-2011/).
