Wired’s Danger Room has an interesting article discussing some of the different online applications being used to track the flooding damage and response in Pakistan. The article puts the efforts of PakReport.org (Rogue Genius team member George Chamales is the tech lead for the deployment) in the context of the bigger picture:

<blockquote>That falls to a group called PakReport, an impromptu collection of Pakistani technologists and their mostly-American academic friends. PakReport is a donor-supported SMS effort that allows people affected by the flood to send in their location and a message about their need. Using a mapping tool called Ushahidi, flood-stricken Pakistanis can find their emergency information tracked by type and location, giving official and independent aid agencies a view into the evolving landscape of people’s needs. Text to 3441 and help create a distributed database of crisis information.</blockquote>
