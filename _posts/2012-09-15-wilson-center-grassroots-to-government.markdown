Rogue Genius team member George Chamales recently took part in a panel discussion on the security challenges of crowdsourcing at the [Connecting Grassroots to Government for Disaster Management Program](http://wilsoncommonslab.org/2012/09/06/webcast-connecting-grassroots-to-government-for-disaster-management/) hosted by the [Wilson Center’s Commons Lab](http://wilsoncommonslab.org/) in Washington DC. From the program’s agenda:

<blockquote>Security of Crowdsourcing
Moderated by Eric Rasmussen, Vice President, AccessAgility, and Managing Director, Infinitum Humanitarian Systems<br/><br/>

Panelists:
• George Chamales, Principal, Rogue Genius LLC
• B.K. DeLong, Principal and Lead Analyst, Extropic Technology Consulting
• Aiden Riley Eller, Vice President of Technology and Security, CoCo Communications

Federal information assurance often tries to eliminate risk. However, because crowdsourcing requires a greater degree of openness, it entails developing practices and technologies to manage risk. What are the emerging standards for crowdsourcing?<br/><br/>

How should federal agencies approach the use of crowdsourcing data to make decisions under conditions of uncertainty? How different is this situation from the usual ‘fog of war’ that surrounds disasters?</blockquote>

The discussion included a great back and forth with the audience and the excellent panelists. Thanks to all who attended in person and online.
