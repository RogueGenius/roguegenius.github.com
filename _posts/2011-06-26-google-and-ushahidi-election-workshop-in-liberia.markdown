Rogue Genius Team Member John Etherton recently spent several days in Liberia discussing the use of new technologies for election monitoring. Excerpt from his blog post:

<blockquote>June 22nd through the 24th Ushahidi Liberia and Google co-hosted <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/techelection/">New Tech at Work: Planning for Liberia’s Election and Beyond</a>, a workshop focusing on how Google and other freely available technologies could be used in and around the planning, execution, and monitoring of the 2011 Liberian Elections. Though to be clear, we did not talk about electronic voting. That’s a whole other can of worms. Google brought in a couple Googlers and hired the Ushahidi Liberia staff and myself to speak at the workshop. The workshop was split into two separate events.</blockquote>
