Team Rogue Genius is pleased to release the Humanitarian Hack Box, a VirtualBox image pre-installed with a number of humanitarian server applications.  The HHB is designed to streamline testing by security professionals interested in finding and fixing vulnerabilities in these programs.  The current set of applications includes [Ushahidi](http://ushahidi.com), [Sahana Eden](http://sahanafoundation.org), and [Openstreetmap](http://openstreetmap.org).  Each of the applications have been installed and run by default when the Virtual Machine is started.  

The image will be used at the upcoming JIFX/RELIEF exercise held at Camp Roberts on August 13th - 17th as well as promoted to various groups interested in submitting the bugs they find to the [Access Innovation Prize](https://www.accessnow.org/prize) for a chance to win $20,000.  Note that applications for the prize are due August 31st.

**[The HHB Image and Documentation is available here.](https://docs.google.com/a/roguegenius.com/folder/d/0B-QB7rXOd9AudzYtWm1pRG1GaHc/edit)**

This page will be used to provide any updates on the image.  If you have specific questions or comments please email [george@roguegenius.com](mailto:george@roguegenius.com)

Happy Hacking.
