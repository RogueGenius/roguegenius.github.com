The Ushahidi developers have recognized a number of active members of the crisis mapping community for their efforts over the past year.  Those recognized include Rogue Genius Team Member George Chamales as the leading community developer for the Ushahidi Web Platform.  A special thanks to the core Ushahidi developers and their exceptional work putting together and promoting the the Ushahidi platform.
From the announcement:
<blockquote>It would be difficult to thank everyone who has helped this year. Instead we wanted to highlight the people who have gone out of their way, sacrificing much of their time and resources so that everyone around the world could benefit. They made the Ushahidi community a better place, and weâ€™re grateful to them for it.
We came up with 8 main areas that we wanted to celebrate, and then the team decided on the people who stood out the most.<br />
