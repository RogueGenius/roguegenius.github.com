FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br/><br/>

PRLog (Press Release) – May 25, 2012 – It is fitting that the world’s largest maritime exercise would include the world’s largest crisis mapping exercise as a component to its planned activities. Last week, volunteers around the world created online content for a crisis map that will be used during the 2012 Rim of the Pacific Exercise (RIMPAC). The virtual crisis team mapping initiative is being orchestrated by Humanity Road, a public charity that trains volunteers on using mobile device and Internet technology to connect those who need aid with those who can provide aid. Over the course of six days in mid-May in Oahu, Hawaii, the U.S. Navy QuickNets Crisis Mapping Exercise completed its mapping activities by creating content that represents thousands of simulated incidents to be referenced during the full simulation RIMPAC slated for July.</blockquote>
